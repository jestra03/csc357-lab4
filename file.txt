The Poem of CSC 357
Systems Programming, is the story of C
the more I program, the more that I see
i like data strucutres, things like tree heaps
and sorting algorithms, order is what i seek
i want to be meek,
gain the wisdom of old,
this CPU is weak,
it must run on coal,
it has no soul,
it is but a machine,
its meaning is null,
i am not mean,
its not what is seems,
i like to program,
not so much math I'm not a fan,
regardless man,
this poem is done, 
much like this program
here are the last two lines
The End
